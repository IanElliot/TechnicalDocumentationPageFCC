    <p>The Prophet Rev2 is a 8/16-voice polyphonic synthesizer with analog
oscillators, filters, and amplifiers. The majority of its sound-shaping
controls are located on its front panel, putting a tremendous amount of
      power and versatility within easy reach.</p>    
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id = "A_Brief_History"><header class="sectionheader">A Brief History</header><p>Dave Smith is an American engineer and musician and founder of the synthesizer company Sequential. Smith was responsible for the first commercial polyphonic and microprocessor-controlled synthesizer, the Prophet-5, and later the multitimbral synthesizer. He is also referred to as the "Father of MIDI" for his role in the development of MIDI, now a standard interface protocol for electronic instruments and recording/pro audio equipment.</p></section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id = "Oscillators"><header class="sectionheader" >Oscillators</header><p>Oscillators provide the raw building blocks of the Prophet Rev2’s sound
by producing waveforms, each of which has its own inherent sound character based on its harmonic content. The Prophet Rev2 has two oscillators, plus a sub oscillator and a noise generator, per voice.</p><p>
Oscillator 1 and 2 are capable of generating sawtooth, sawtooth + triangle, triangle, and pulse waves. You can vary the width of any of these
waveshapes using the shape mod parameter. This provides a great variety
of different waveshapes and timbres. </p></section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id = "Filter"><header class="sectionheader">Filter</header><p>The Filter takes the basic, raw sound of the oscillators and noise generator and subtracts frequencies, changing the harmonic content and character of their sound. This change can be varied over time using the Filter
Envelope to produce more dynamic, animated timbres.</p><p>The Prophet Rev2’s filter is a classic, resonant low-pass Curtis filter that is
switchable between 2-pole operation (12 dB per octave) and 4-pole operation
(24 dB per octave). The 4-pole filter can self-oscillate when resonance is
set to its maximum.</p></section>
  
  
  <section class="main-section" id = "Filter_Envelope"><header class="sectionheader">Filter Envelope</header><p>The Prophet Rev2 filter has a dedicated, five-stage envelope generator
(DADSR). The Filter Envelope is used to shape the harmonic characteristics of a synthesized sound by giving you filtering control over its
attack, decay, sustain, and release stages (plus a delay parameter to delay
the onset of the envelope). </p><p>This is one of the most important aspects of designing a sound. Without
an envelope, the filters would be completely static. They would stay open
or closed by a fixed amount that wouldn’t change over the duration of a
sound. That’s not very interesting to listen to and it’s not how instruments
behave in the real world. </p><p>In general, sounds produced by an instrument are brighter at their beginning (the attack stage) and grow mellower as they die out (the decay and
release stages). In other words, their harmonic content changes over time.
This is exactly what the filter envelope is designed to emulate.</p></section>
  
<section class="main-section" id = "Amplifier_Envelope"><header class="sectionheader">Amplifier Envelope</header><p>After passing through the filters, a synthesized sound goes into an analog
voltage controlled amplifier or VCA, which controls its overall volume.
The VCA has a dedicated, five-stage envelope generator (DADSR). </p><p>The Amplifier Envelope is used to shape the volume characteristics of a
sound over time by giving you control over its attack, decay, sustain, and
release stages (plus a delay parameter to delay the onset of the envelope).
Along with the filter envelope, this is one of the most important factors
in designing a sound. </p><p>Without a volume envelope, the volume of a sound wouldn’t change
over the duration of a note. It would begin immediately, remain at its full
volume for the duration of the note, then end immediately when the note
was released. Again, that’s not very interesting sonically and it’s not typically how instruments behave in the real world. </p><p>To give you a real-world example, the main difference between the
sound of the wind and the sound of a snare drum is that they have very
different volume envelopes. Otherwise, they are essentially both white
noise. Wind has a relatively slow attack, a long sustain, and a long decay
and release. A snare drum has a sharp attack, no sustain, and very little
decay or release. But again, they are both fundamentally white noise.</p></section>
